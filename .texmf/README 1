This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

All TeX Font Metric files (suffix .tfm in subdirectory fonts/tfm),
Virtual Fonts (suffix  .vf in subdirectory fonts/vf) etc. are
derived from the relevant Latin Modern fonts, version 2.004,
released by GUST and available from
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern. The TFM and
VF files are derived specifically from the Adobe Font Metric (suffix
.afm) and TeX Font Metric (suffix .tfm) files supplied with the 
postscript type 1 version of the fonts.

The encoding t1-clm.etx is derived from the file t1.etx supplied with
fontinst. A copy of fontinst including an unmodified copy of t1.etx is 
available from http://mirror.ctan.org/fonts/utilities/fontinst.

Selected Version History
------------------------

This version of the package has benefited greatly from feedback
provided by Enrico Gregorio, who essentially rewrote the style file
using keyval to show me how I ought to be setting the various options
up, and Lars Hellstr√∂m who demonstrated considerable patience in 
answering my many questions about using fontinst and some peculiarities
of the Latin Modern fonts.

Version 1.4 adds experimental support for microtype. While this 
should work fine since it basically uses the settings for Latin Modern and
Computer Modern Roman, I'm far from confident about this.

Version 1.5 corrects 2 typos in the -drv.tex files (1 in each). These caused
inaccuracies in two of the .fd files. Since it takes a long time to run
fontinst, the .fd files have been corrected by hand in a way which should, I
hope effect the same corrections as would be obtained by recreating them.

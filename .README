title: .dotfiles repo

Introduction
============

This is a git repo for all my (important) dotfiles.

Creating from Existing Repo
===========================

Alias `git` to make things easier (the alias should already be in the repo's
`.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or whatever, but we don't have that `.*rc` file yet):

    alias cfg='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree 

Do a good old clone:

    git clone --bare <URL> $HOME/.dotfiles

Check that shit out:

    cfg checkout

This command may fail if there are files that exist in the remote repo and in the
local home directory. Do something with those files (i.e., delete or move them)
to fix that.

Don't forget to ignore untracked files:

    cfg config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

Submodules
----------

If there are submodules (such as `.oh-my-zsh` and vim plugins), git will *not*
download those automatically (since only their commit IDs are downloaded, not
the actuall commits). You'll need to initialize and update them:

    cfg submodule init
    cfg submodule update
    
Or:

    cfg submodule update --init

(This might need to be done recursively if your submodules have submodules,
too.)

Creating a New Dotfile Repo
===========================

This is for starting *totally* from scratch.

Initialize:

    git init --bare $HOME/.dotfiles

The repo is `$HOME/.dotfiles`, but we want the work tree (i.e., the checked out
files) to be in `$HOME` itself:

    alias cfg='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree 

(Add that alias to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or whatever.)

Now ignore all untracked files, since a .gitignore would take too much work to
manage:
    
    cfg config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

For the dotfiles repository, you usually should be using the `cfg` command (and
not `git`) to add/remove/push/etc.

Be sure that ".dotfiles" is in `.gitignore`, to avoid recursive Fun.
